# Who I am

It is my childhood dream to be part of the video game development industry. I never gave up on this dream. I even formed my own team. For the past 6 years, I have been part of a project which protects shared hosting servers. We currently protecting more than 7000 servers world hide. But it's time to switch. I'm a very motivated and talented developer. I also managed to find solutions to seemingly impossible problems in the course of my work.
My goal is to participate in developments that can make people’s lives happier and better.

Let’s make the world a happier, safer place together!
